## Time Complexity
The time complexity of a algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an
algorithm to run as a function of the length of the string representing the
input.

## Elementary Operations
An Elementary operation is the operation which takes a fixed amount of time to
perform.

Time complexity is commonly estimated by counting the number of elementary
operations performed by the algorithm.

The amount of time taken and the number of elementary operations performed by
the algorithm differ by at most a constant factor.

$T = t * n$, ($T$ is the amount of time taken by the algorithm, $t$ is the
averge time of the operations, $n$ is the number of elementary operations).

## Big-O notation
The time complexity of an algorithm expressed using big-O notation, which
excludes coefficients and lower order items (asymptotically).
